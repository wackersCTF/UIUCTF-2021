I got a lot of items to sell so buy buy buy.

# How to "Capture the Flag":
In the competition discord server, there is a bot named "The Auction House," which auctions stuff (including three types of flags). The three types of flags have different values depending on their rarity. The Ultra Rare Flag is the flag that costs the most, then the Rare Flag, and then the Common Flag. All three of these flags are to be bought or won from bidding in the ```#charl1e-chapl1n``` channel of the discord server.

After obtaining the three flags, you can redeem them by using ```/redeem_flags```. This will DM you the flag (if you have all three flags).

Here is the list of commands (the most important ones):

```/bid``` - Lets you bid on an item (having specified the amount of money to bid and the name of the item). Note: keep in mind that the item has to be on the auction list.

```/public_auction_items``` - Shows which items are being auctioned in the public auction room.

```/buy``` - Lets you buy the item for face value (as seen on the marketplace), having specified the item type, the item itself, and the number of items. Note: this is optional.

```/marketplace``` - Shows the list of all items available, the item type, and face value of the item.

```/redeem_flags``` - The command which allows you to get the flag (if and only if you have all three types of flags). The auction bot DM's you the flag if you have all three types of flags.
