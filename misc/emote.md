# emote
by ian5v
## Description
recently i've been converting strings into images for funsies and staring at them. anytime time to go share those images with my friends in discord! warning: staring at noise in visual form may or may not introduce you to the abyss

## Solution
The description talks about an :emote: from discord so our image to use will be the :emote: from their discord server.

By testing out different stegonography tools, eventually we will see a flag by using zsteg on the image.

flag: ```uiuctf{staring_at_pixels_is_fun}```
