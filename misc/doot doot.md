## Description
From the creator of "Shrek but only when ANYONE says 'E'", we bring you the most-viewed-YouTube video of all time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos#Top_videos 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNXl9fqGX40

## Solution
The first link given is more for information.

The second link is the one where the flag is hidden.

We see that it is an 8 hour long video so trying to parse through the video for the flag might not be very easy.

Sadly, the way I did it was by getting lucky and parsing through the entire video for the flag.

Note: ```I'm pretty sure there is a legit way to do this challenge but I am just bad.```

The flag appears on the screen at ```5:24:59```

flag: ```uiuctf{doot_d0ot_do0t_arent_you_tired_of_the_int4rnet?}```
