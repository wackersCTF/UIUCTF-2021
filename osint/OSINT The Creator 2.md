# OSINT The Creator 2
Solved By: RJCyber

## Description:
I released another flag somewhere on one of my Twitter accounts. Can you find it?!

## How to "Capture the Flag":
The description says that the flag is on one of his Twitter accounts. If we take a look at the creator's (Thomas) infosec Twitter account (https://twitter.com/0xQuig), there is a link to his personal Twitter account (https://twitter.com/Thomas_Quig).
